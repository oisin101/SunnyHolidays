                <p>The west pier overlooking Howth is where you can find some of the best seafood in the country.

                    Beshoff's is rumored to have the best fish & chips in the area. Because this place sells caught fish
                    directly from the seaside, you can't get any fresher than right from the sea to your plate. Even if you're looking
                    for something else there are plenty of options. The Abbey Tavern has a vegan menu for people that would prefer
                    plant based meals.

                    The best way to end a sunny day in Howth is with an ice cream cone by the sea.

                    fresh flavours in an Italian style gelato, of which is all homemade. <a href="https://speckontheglobe.com/2014/08/17/snapshot-sunday">

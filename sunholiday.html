                <h3>Choice of Beaches</h3>
                <p class="col"> There are several options for delicious meals in Howth.

                    Beshoff's is rumored to have the best fish & chips in the area. Because this place sells caught fish
                    directly from the seaside, you can't get any fresher than right from the sea to your plate. Even if you're looking
                    for something else there are plenty of options. The Abbey Tavern has a vegan menu for people that would prefer
                    plant based meals. Beshoff's is rumored to have the best fish & chips in the area. Because this place sells caught fish

                    The best way to end a sunny day in Howth is with an ice cream cone by the sea.
                    Nearby there is a small ice cream shop to stop by for a scoop which come in various
                    fresh flavours in an Italian style gelato, of which is all homemade. <a href="https://speckontheglobe.com/2014/08/17/snapshot-sunday-sunny-afternoon-in-howth-ireland/">
